            <p>Disclaimers: </p>
            <p>1) Crypto investments are very risky. Do your own research.</p>
            <p>2) You can lose ALL your capital. Only invest if you can afford to lose it all.</p>
            <p>3) All posts here are personal opinions. NOT financial / investment advice.</p>

            <p>First thoughts on Crypto: Getting past the 1st wave of resistance</p>
            <p>Only read on if you've gotten past the mind-boggling issues paralyzing the mainstream now regarding issues of: "Isn't crypto a scam?", "Isn't it bad for the environment?" and "The governments are going to ban it all!" </p>
            <br>
            <p><u>Portfolio diversification:</u></p>
            <p>This is my personal investment style, whether thru traditional finance (Equities) or Crypto. It's always less exciting to have your returns channelled through 15-20 assets within a portfolio, vs just holding a single asset. But it allows me to sleep soundly at night, and that's just priceless.</p>
            <p>Model portfolio of tokens diversified across four segments: 3 'blue-chips' (BTC, ETH, BNB) and 1 'VC-style' sub-portfolio of tokens:</p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>== BTC ==</strong>: Digital Gold
            <br>If you haven't heard of Bitcoin(BTC), you've probably been living in a cave somewhere. No excuses even during Covid times... The concept of BTC being digital gold has been bandied around for awhile now, and when enough people believe in it, it eventually becomes true. Strong belief that BTC will remain an undeniable store of value for a long time to come.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Proof of Work needs to go - extremely inefficient method of validation. Improvements (if any) are likely to be a price catalyst.
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>== ETH ==</strong>: Crypto's Foundational Platform
            <br>ETH has always played 2nd fiddle to BTC since the inception of Cryptocurrencies, but has recently become the go-to platform for blockchain app development and the foundation for all things De-Fi (decentralised finance). Smart Contract capability allows everything from DExes (Decentralised Exchanges) to NFTs to be built on the Ethereum platform, and has given a corresponding boost to ETH demand. The move towards PoS (Proof of Stake) can only further its potential and value.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: ETH has become a victim of its own success. Gas fees (transaction fees) have now become relatively exorbitant due to the surge in on-chain traffic. We're all very much looking forward to ETH v2 (in progress).
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>== BNB ==</strong>: Mainstream's gateway and super-app
            <br>Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, and its CEO, CZ's visionary plans for the company contributes to growth in leaps and bounds. BNB is the native token of the Binance Exchange, and its utility can only see tremendous upside given increased interest in Crypto trading and functionality built within the Binance Eco-system (eg: upcoming NFT Marketplace). Being the fiat gateway for hordes of new investors every day, it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the impending movement of Crypto going mainstream.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Binance, being a Central Exchange, can be said to be going against the true ideals of the Crypto World: that of trustlessness and decentralisation. As the De-Fi movement gathers pace, will Binance still remain relevant in the long term?
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>== VC Bucket ==</strong> : focused on Defi and some retail-friendly projects
            <br>Still building...
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>== NFTs? ==</strong>: Still not getting this as images not stored on-chain
            <br>...but doesn't mean it won't make you tons of $$$. To each his own.</p>
