            <p>1) Crypto investments are very risky. Do your own research.</p>

            <p>First thoughts on Crypto: Getting past the 1st wave of resistance</p>
            <p>Only read on if you've gotten past the mind-boggling issues paralyzing the mainstream now regarding issues of: "Isn't crypto a scam?", "Isn't it bad for the environment?" and "The governments are going to ban it all!" </p>
            <br>
            <p><u>Portfolio diversification:</u></p>
            <p>This is my personal investment style, whether thru traditional finance (Equities) or Crypto. It's always less exciting to have your returns channelled through 15-20 assets within a portfolio, vs just holding a single asset. But it allows me to sleep soundly at night, and that's just priceless.</p>
            <p>Model portfolio of tokens roughly divided into a four buckets: 3 'blue-chips' (BTC, ETH, BNB) and 1 'VC-style' bucket of tokens:</p>
            <p><strong>BTC</strong>: Digital Gold</p>
            <p><strong>ETH</strong>: Crypto's Foundational Platform</p>
            <p><strong>BNB</strong>: Mainstream's gateway and super-app</p>
            <p><strong>VC Bucket</strong> : focused on Defi and some retail-friendly projects</p>
