                What. A. Ride. <br> Even though I've followed my own advice to only invest with money I can afford to lose, to go from a +50% to -50% portfolio position in a matter of days is something that I would safely say is a new nerve-wracking experience for me. <br><br>
                So after the dust has settled, the dollar-cost averaging implemented, how does the portfolio now look?<br>
                For one, MATIC (Polygon) has been bumped up to one of my core 'foundational layer' tokens. The widespread growth and acceptance of this L2 solution to ETH's scaling issues has just been phenomenal, resulting in its dramatic growth in value within the portfolio. To the keen-eyed, you will notice that MATIC has already 'flipped' BTC (17.9% vs 14.6%). I've decided to leave the allocation as such due to my belief in its potential to outperform.<br><br>
                The rest of the tokens are my 'revealed' VC-type allocation. While I recognise that some of these tokens to some would be already considered mainstream, my thesis is that all these tokens still have at least a 5x-10x potential, especially when pegged to BTC's market cap. Going forward, I will start to explore tokens lower down the list of main-stream-ness, but for now these are the chosen ones. All these tokens are kept to a 5% or lower allocation. These tokens can be broadly categorised into Chains (Solana, Fantom), Networks (Chainlink) and Dexes/De-fi platforms (Sushi, Yearn, Aave, Pancakeswap). <br><br>
                Of course there's the small allocation to NFTs (Decentraland, some NFT art). I'll likely go into the Decentraland experience in more detail in a later post. Watch this space. <br><br>

            <h3>First thoughts on Crypto: Getting past the 1st wave of resistance</h3>
            <p>Only read on if you've gotten past the mind-boggling issues paralyzing the mainstream now regarding issues of: "Isn't crypto a scam?", "Isn't it bad for the environment?" and "The governments are going to ban it all!" </p>
            <br>
            <p><u>Portfolio diversification:</u></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">This is my personal investment style, whether thru traditional finance (Equities) or Crypto. It's always less exciting to have your returns channelled through 15-20 assets within a portfolio, vs just holding a single asset. But it allows me to sleep soundly at night, and that's just priceless.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">Model portfolio of tokens diversified across five segments: 3 'blue-chips' (BTC, ETH, BNB) + a 'VC-style' sub-portfolio of tokens + small allocation to NFT art</p>

            <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] BTC </strong>: Digital Gold
            <br>If you haven't heard of Bitcoin(BTC), you've probably been living in a cave somewhere. No excuses even during Covid times... The concept of BTC being digital gold has been bandied around for awhile now, and when enough people believe in it, it eventually becomes true. Strong belief that BTC will remain an undeniable store of value for a long time to come.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Proof of Work needs to go - extremely inefficient method of validation. Improvements (if any) are likely to be a price catalyst.
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] ETH </strong>: Crypto's Foundational Platform
            <br>ETH has always played 2nd fiddle to BTC since the inception of Cryptocurrencies, but has recently become the go-to platform for blockchain app development and the foundation for all things De-Fi (decentralised finance). Smart Contract capability allows everything from DExes (Decentralised Exchanges) to NFTs to be built on the Ethereum platform, and has given a corresponding boost to ETH demand. The move towards PoS (Proof of Stake) can only further its potential and value.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: ETH has become a victim of its own success. Gas fees (transaction fees) have now become relatively exorbitant due to the surge in on-chain traffic. We're all very much looking forward to ETH v2 (in progress).
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] BNB </strong>: Mainstream's gateway and super-app
            <br>Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, and its CEO, CZ's visionary plans for the company contributes to growth in leaps and bounds. BNB is the native token of the Binance Exchange, and its utility can only see tremendous upside given increased interest in Crypto trading and functionality built within the Binance Eco-system (eg: upcoming NFT Marketplace). Being the fiat gateway for hordes of new investors every day, it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the impending movement of Crypto going mainstream.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Binance, being a Central Exchange, can be said to be going against the true ideals of the Crypto World: that of trustlessness and decentralisation. As the De-Fi movement gathers pace, will Binance still remain relevant in the long term?
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[15-25%] VC Allocation </strong> : focused on Defi and some retail-friendly projects
            <br>Some of the categories of the high-risk/high-potential projects include: L1 and L2 chain tokens and defi-exchange native tokens. I'll probably go into more of that in a later post, as this section is constantly evolving.
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[3-7%] NFTs? </strong>: Still not getting this as images not stored on-chain
            <br>...but doesn't mean it won't make you tons of $$$. To each his own. I've recently invested in a parcel of LAND within Decentraland. It's not NFT art, but LAND (an NFT native to Decentraland depicting ownership of virtual real estate) is something more understandable to me (see my trad-fi investments in REITS within the real world). Will also aim to go a little more into the Decentraland experience in a later post.</p><br>
