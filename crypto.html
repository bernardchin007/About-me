            <h3>Decentraland: The Virtual Tour</h3>
            <p>So enough about portfolio allocation, the crypto crash and onto more light-hearted and fun stuff. In these times of the Covid pandemic, what better way to scratch your travel itch than to visit a virtual world where you could meet new friends and potentially make some money off owning real-estate? IMHO, there's no better way to bridge the real 'meat' world and the virtual world of NFTs through a platform like Decentraland (DCL). Let's dive straight in.<br><br>
                First, the basics: <br>
                DCL is a virtual world where you have the ability to own plots of LAND (which are NFTs) within a fixed, pre-generated environment. You can build and create simple 3D improvements to your plot of LAND, which I will go into more detail later. LAND and other in-game wearable purchases can be made using DCL's native token, MANA. As the DCL world is built on the Ethereum blockchain, gas fees are paid in ETH for all payment transactions. At the time of writing, LAND isn't considered 'cheap' by any measure, and the cheapest parcel (one smallest unit you can own) goes for around 4,500 MANA (~USD 3.3k). Gas fees on the ETH network can also add painfully to the bill when the network gets congested. <br><br>
                A map of the pre-generated DCL world is below. Total LAND: 96,601 parcels, broken down into ~44k private parcels (dark grey), ~34k district parcels (blue/purple), 9k parcels of road (light grey) and 4k parcels of plaza (green). The private parcels are the ones you can own/buy/sell.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:center">
                <img src="images/dcl-map.png" alt="dcl-map-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">source: market.decentraland.org</p>
<br>
            <p>
                So this (below) is the starting spawn point of DCL, after you enter the world by clicking a few links from <a href="https://decentraland.org/" style="color:white"> here: </a> The DCL world runs from your browser, so no installation of any sort is required.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center">
                <img src="images/dcl-start.png" alt="dcl-start-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>
            <p>
                Your movement in DCL is controlled either by a 1st-person perspective or 3rd-person depending on your preference. And you move/look around using the standard 'WASD' keys and your mouse. It will come second nature to those used to playing FPS or 3D action RPGs. The game doesn't make it obvious for beginners, but the starting spawn point I believe is to get people to read announcements and event notices. To start the game, you need to dive into the whirlpool.
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
                After you emerge from the whirlpool and the DCL lobby, the below view is pretty much the start of the DCL world that you'll see. The in-game graphics are pretty simple, but I'm guessing that there are limitations to what a browser-based game engine can deliver.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:center">
                <img src="images/dcl-lobby.png" alt="dcl-lobby-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
                You can walk around and explore the world at your own time, but there is a simple in-game teleportation mechanic if you wish to visit a specific parcel of land: just enter "/goto X,Y" in the chat bar, where X and Y are the respective coordinates desired. Let's head over to my personal parcel to have a look, shall we?
            </p> <br>
            <p style="text-align:center">
                <img src="images/dcl-ownplot.png" alt="dcl-ownplot-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>

            <p>
                So the above is my plot (27,-145). Thanks for visiting. <br><br>
                Virtual land purchased with real-life money, and with cautious optimism... profits to be realised in the future (please re-read disclaimers above). Once again, graphics are nothing to shout about. But you can customise and build your plot with a simple in-game builder which gives you access to a library of 3D assets to plonk around in your estate. You can actually build much more complex structures and buildings (see the glass multi-story house in the background) using 3rd-party 3D-modelling software and importing the build, but I won't go into that in this post. <br><br>
                The coolest basic feature for me is having the ability to display an NFT collection via canvases - you can see my starter collection peeking out from behind the coconut trees. Pretty cool huh?</p><br>

            <p style="text-align:center">
                <img src="images/dcl-nfts.png" alt="dcl-nfts-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Apart from that, DCL developers are still fleshing out mechanics where you can play some simple games like betting virtual currency on a horse race, playing simple arcade games through a partnership with Atari... but I believe this is just the beginning. As our PCs and mobile phones get more powerful, the technical aspects of the DCL world will only improve, and with it, exponentially grow the potential of this virtual world.
                <br><br>
                Well that sums up a quick tour and first-impressions of DCL. Feel free to get in touch if you've any comments or queries.

            <h3>How my strategy adapted post-THE Crash</h3>

            <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="images/20210526-c-portfolio.png" alt="c-portfolio-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>
            <p>
                What. A. Ride. <br> Even though I've followed my own advice to only invest with money I can afford to lose, to go from a +50% to -50% portfolio position in a matter of days is something that I would safely say is a new nerve-wracking experience for me. <br><br>
                So after the dust has settled, the dollar-cost averaging implemented, how does the portfolio now look?<br>
                For one, MATIC (Polygon) has been bumped up to one of my core 'foundational layer' tokens. The widespread growth and acceptance of this L2 solution to ETH's scaling issues has just been phenomenal, resulting in its dramatic growth in value within the portfolio. To the keen-eyed, you will notice that MATIC has already 'flipped' BTC (16.0% vs 14.1%). I've decided to leave the allocation as such due to my belief in its potential to outperform.<br><br>
                Another significant change comes in the form of an increased allocation to AAVE (to 9.4%), due mainly to the MATIC (Polygon) rewards on their platform. Although the rewards program only lasts for a limited time, it's worth checking out due to the incentives for both lending and borrowing. It's also a good opportunity to understand the dynamic lending/borrowing environment on an established De-Fi platform while earning a decent return on your tokens. The rewards are given in wMATIC (wrapped MATIC) tokens which require a bit of magic on QuickSwap to unwrap, but not exactly rocket-science either.
                <br><br>
                The rest of the tokens are my 'revealed' VC-type allocation. While I recognise that some of these tokens to some would be already considered mainstream, my thesis is that all these tokens still have at least a 5x-10x potential, especially when pegged to BTC's market cap. Going forward, I will start to explore tokens lower down the list of main-stream-ness, but for now these are the chosen ones. All these tokens are kept to a 5% or lower allocation. These tokens can be broadly categorised into Chains (Solana, Fantom), Oracles (Chainlink) and Dexes/De-fi platforms (Sushi, Yearn, Pancakeswap). <br><br>
                Of course there's the small allocation to NFTs (Decentraland, some NFT art). I'll likely go into the Decentraland experience in more detail in a later post. Watch this space. <br><br>

            <h3>First thoughts on Crypto: Getting past the 1st wave of resistance</h3>
            <p>Only read on if you've gotten past the mind-boggling issues paralyzing the mainstream now regarding issues of: "Isn't crypto a scam?", "Isn't it bad for the environment?" and "The governments are going to ban it all!" </p>
            <br>
            <p><u>Portfolio diversification:</u></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">This is my personal investment style, whether thru traditional finance (Equities) or Crypto. It's always less exciting to have your returns channelled through 15-20 assets within a portfolio, vs just holding a single asset. But it allows me to sleep soundly at night, and that's just priceless.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">Model portfolio of tokens diversified across five segments: 3 'blue-chips' (BTC, ETH, BNB) + a 'VC-style' sub-portfolio of tokens + small allocation to NFT art</p>

            <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="images/portfolio.png" alt="portfolio-img" style="max-width:95%;border: 6px solid #555;">
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] BTC </strong>: Digital Gold
            <br>If you haven't heard of Bitcoin(BTC), you've probably been living in a cave somewhere. No excuses even during Covid times... The concept of BTC being digital gold has been bandied around for awhile now, and when enough people believe in it, it eventually becomes true. Strong belief that BTC will remain an undeniable store of value for a long time to come.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Proof of Work needs to go - extremely inefficient method of validation. Improvements (if any) are likely to be a price catalyst.
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] ETH </strong>: Crypto's Foundational Platform
            <br>ETH has always played 2nd fiddle to BTC since the inception of Cryptocurrencies, but has recently become the go-to platform for blockchain app development and the foundation for all things De-Fi (decentralised finance). Smart Contract capability allows everything from DExes (Decentralised Exchanges) to NFTs to be built on the Ethereum platform, and has given a corresponding boost to ETH demand. The move towards PoS (Proof of Stake) can only further its potential and value.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: ETH has become a victim of its own success. Gas fees (transaction fees) have now become relatively exorbitant due to the surge in on-chain traffic. We're all very much looking forward to ETH v2 (in progress).
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[20-30%] BNB </strong>: Mainstream's gateway and super-app
            <br>Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, and its CEO, CZ's visionary plans for the company contributes to growth in leaps and bounds. BNB is the native token of the Binance Exchange, and its utility can only see tremendous upside given increased interest in Crypto trading and functionality built within the Binance Eco-system (eg: upcoming NFT Marketplace). Being the fiat gateway for hordes of new investors every day, it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the impending movement of Crypto going mainstream.
            <br><br><i>Criticisms</i>: Binance, being a Central Exchange, can be said to be going against the true ideals of the Crypto World: that of trustlessness and decentralisation. As the De-Fi movement gathers pace, will Binance still remain relevant in the long term?
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[15-25%] VC Allocation </strong> : focused on Defi and some retail-friendly projects
            <br>Some of the categories of the high-risk/high-potential projects include: L1 and L2 chain tokens and defi-exchange native tokens. I'll probably go into more of that in a later post, as this section is constantly evolving.
            </p><br>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"><strong>[3-7%] NFTs? </strong>: Still not getting this as images not stored on-chain
            <br>...but doesn't mean it won't make you tons of $$$. To each his own. I've recently invested in a parcel of LAND within Decentraland. It's not NFT art, but LAND (an NFT native to Decentraland depicting ownership of virtual real estate) is something more understandable to me (see my trad-fi investments in REITS within the real world). Will also aim to go a little more into the Decentraland experience in a later post.</p><br>
